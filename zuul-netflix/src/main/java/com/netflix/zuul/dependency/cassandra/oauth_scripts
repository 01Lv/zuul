Hi Mike,
Made inline correction (changed read_repair_chance=1 from 0). Also, was it consumerkeys that will have ~10,000,000 rows?. Please change keys_cached to 500000 for that

Nitish,
 Here are  my final keyspace andcolumn family definitions. Please let me know if there are any changes that should be made to them.

thanks!
